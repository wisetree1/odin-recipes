    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I always order moo shu pork in Chinese restaurants and wanted to try making it at home using a combination of recipes. You can find Chinese pancakes at Asian grocery stores. Let everyone fill their own pancakes and top with the hoisin sauce mixture — it absolutely makes this dish!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white wine</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons cornstarch</li>
        <li>1 pound pork tenderloin, cut into thin strips</li>
        <li>1 ¾ ounces dried shiitake mushrooms</li>
        <li>½ cup sliced green onions</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons peeled and minced fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 head napa cabbage</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white wine</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon cornstarch</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, plus more if needed</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white wine</li>
        <li>1 cup hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>16 frozen Chinese pancakes, thawed and warmed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place 2 tablespoons of soy sauce, 2 tablespoons of white wine, 1 teaspoon of sesame oil, and 2 teaspoons of cornstarch in a non-reactive bowl; stir until smooth. Stir pork into marinade until thoroughly coated; refrigerate for 30 minutes to an hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, pour hot water over mushrooms in a bowl; set aside to soften for 15 to 20 minutes. Drain mushrooms; pat dry, remove any hard stem pieces, and finely chop. Combine mushrooms, green onions, garlic, and ginger in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Remove outer leaves from napa cabbage; tear green leafy portions from the central stalks of the leaves. Slice stalks into thin 1-inch pieces. Finely chop green leafy portions, and set aside the sliced stems and chopped leaves in separate bowls.</li>
        <li>Combine 3 tablespoons of soy sauce, 3 tablespoons of white wine, 1/2 teaspoon of cornstarch, sugar, and ground black pepper in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Heat vegetable oil and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add marinated pork; cook and stir until cooked through and edges have begun to brown, about 5 minutes. Transfer pork to a bowl.</li>
        <li>Pour beaten eggs into the hot wok, adding more vegetable oil if necessary; cook and stir until eggs are scrambled, firm, and well-broken up, about 2 minutes. Stir in mushroom mixture; cook and stir 1 to 2 minutes. Add napa cabbage stem pieces; cook and stir until hot but still crunchy, about 1 minute. Add chopped cabbage leaves and 2 tablespoons of white wine; cook and stir until hot, about 1 minute. Add cooked pork and reserved cornstarch mixture. Stir everything together until slightly thickened and hot, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix hoisin sauce, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce, and 1 teaspoon of sesame oil in a small bowl until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>To serve, spread about 1 tablespoon of hoisin mixture on each pancake, top with about 1/2 cup of the pork mixture, roll, and serve.</li>
    </ol>
